# Trees

## Description
- Detailed and organized coverage of the topic with documentation including (but not limited to) example Python code, diagrams, and tables.
- What is the purpose of the data structure?
- What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?
- What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?
- How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?
- What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

## Example
- A complete example of a problem solved using the data structure.

## Practice
- A second problem (again created by you) which is given to the student of your tutorial to solve on their own. You need to provide a link to the solution.
