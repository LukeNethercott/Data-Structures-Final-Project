# Data Structures Tutorial
## Stacks - Linked Lists - Trees

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. In this tutorial we will cover just three of the many data structures that programmers use:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-lists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.
